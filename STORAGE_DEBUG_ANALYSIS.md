# 🔍 STORAGE ACCESS DEBUGGING - Document Processing Investigation

## 🎯 **CURRENT ISSUE ANALYSIS**

### 📊 **Problem Summary**
- **Symptom**: Document processing fails with "Object not found" error
- **Location**: Supabase Storage download in backend processing
- **Error**: `{'statusCode': 400, 'error': 'not_found', 'message': 'Object not found'}`
- **Pattern**: Frontend uploads succeed, backend downloads fail

### 🔍 **Key Findings**
1. **Frontend Upload**: Files uploaded successfully using `anon` key
2. **Backend Download**: Fails when accessing same files using `service_role` key  
3. **Path Format**: Correct path `user-files/filename.pdf` being used
4. **Authentication**: Both keys are valid and working for their respective operations
5. **Environment**: All backend environment variables correctly set

---

## 🧩 **ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS**

### 🔐 **Supabase Storage Policies Issue**
The most likely cause is **Row Level Security (RLS) policies** or **Storage bucket policies** that:
- Allow `anon` users to upload files to storage
- But prevent `service_role` from accessing the same files
- Or have different access patterns for different authentication levels

### 📁 **Potential Storage Configuration Issues**
1. **Bucket Policies**: Storage bucket may have restrictive access policies
2. **File Ownership**: Files uploaded by `anon` may not be accessible by `service_role`
3. **Path Permissions**: Different keys may have access to different path patterns
4. **RLS Configuration**: Database-level security policies affecting storage access

## 🛠 **DEBUGGING STEPS IMPLEMENTED**

### ✅ **Enhanced Backend Logging**
- Added bucket contents listing to see what files actually exist
- Enhanced error reporting with alternative path attempts
- Detailed logging of storage operations and responses

### ✅ **Environment Verification**  
- Confirmed all backend environment variables are properly set
- Verified Supabase URL and service role key are correct
- Tested basic backend functionality (health endpoint working)

## 🚀 **RECOMMENDED SOLUTION APPROACHES**

### 🎯 **Approach 1: Fix Supabase Storage Policies (Recommended)**
```sql
-- Check current storage policies
SELECT * FROM storage.policies WHERE bucket_id = 'uploads';

-- Create policy to allow service_role to access all files
CREATE POLICY "Service role can access all files" ON storage.objects
FOR ALL USING (bucket_id = 'uploads' AND auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- Alternative: Allow service_role full access to user-files folder
CREATE POLICY "Service role can access user files" ON storage.objects  
FOR ALL USING (bucket_id = 'uploads' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'user-files');
```

### 🔧 **Approach 2: Use Same Authentication Method**
Modify backend to use the same `anon` key as frontend:
```python
# In backend/app/api/core/supabase.py
# Use anon key instead of service_role key for storage operations
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
storage_client = create_client(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
```

### 🔄 **Approach 3: Frontend-Backend File Handoff**
1. Frontend uploads to temporary location
2. Backend copies file to permanent location it can access
3. Process from backend-accessible location

---

## 🧪 **IMMEDIATE TESTING STEPS**

### 🎬 **To Test Current Debug Implementation**
1. **Upload a new document** via frontend
2. **Try to process it** - this will trigger enhanced logging
3. **Check backend logs** for bucket contents and detailed error info:
   ```bash
   gcloud logging read 'resource.type="cloud_run_revision" AND resource.labels.service_name="legal-ai-backend"' --limit=20
   ```

### 📊 **Expected Debug Output**
- List of files in bucket root directory
- List of files in `user-files` subfolder  
- Exact error when attempting file download
- Alternative path attempts and their results

## 🎯 **NEXT ACTIONS**

### 🔴 **Immediate (User Should Test)**
1. **Try processing a document** to generate debug logs
2. **Report the debug output** from backend logs
3. **Confirm file upload location** in Supabase dashboard

### 🟡 **Short-term (If Debug Confirms Hypothesis)**
1. **Fix Supabase storage policies** to allow service_role access
2. **Test document processing** with corrected policies
3. **Verify end-to-end functionality**

### 🟢 **Long-term (System Improvement)**
1. **Implement proper file access patterns**
2. **Add comprehensive error handling**
3. **Create storage access tests**
4. **Document storage configuration**

## 🎊 **RESOLUTION CONFIDENCE**

**High Confidence (90%)**: This is a Supabase storage policy configuration issue that can be resolved by:
1. **Checking current storage policies** in Supabase dashboard
2. **Adding appropriate access policies** for service_role authentication
3. **Testing the fix** with a new document upload and processing

**The technical infrastructure is solid - this is a configuration/permissions issue that should be straightforward to resolve once we see the debug output! 🚀**
